Iqra Course

Learning the Qur'an for early childhood is often a challenge for parents. The background of this problem is the confusion of parents in choosing the right teaching method, traditional methods that tend to be monotonous, making children bored, and the absence of structured feedback on children's learning progress. This research aims to design an interactive and user-friendly “Iqra' Course” learning application prototype as a solution to overcome these problems. The design method used is user-centered Design Thinking through five stages: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. The discussion in this study resulted in a prototype of a high-fidelity application equipped with features such as interactive materials, pronunciation audio, and achievement reports to answer user needs. The results of the prototype testing showed very positive achievements. Evaluation using Maze Testing gave a Usability Score of 90, indicating high ease of use and efficiency of interaction. These results were reinforced by scores from the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) which confirmed the user experience with an "Excellent" predicate on the aspects of Pragmatic Quality (functionality) and Hedonic Quality (pleasant experience), proving this prototype has the potential to be an effective learning tool.
